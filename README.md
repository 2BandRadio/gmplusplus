# GMplusplus

Value change listeners created with Violentmonkey's `GM_addValueChangeListener` may sometimes fail to fire when a previously deleted value is recreated with the same data it held before. GMplusplus primarily remedies that issue while also altering and extending GM_* functionality. See the source for documentation of new or altered functionality.
